# 2. High-Level Architecture

## Technical Summary

This project will be a **serverless, full-stack application** built using a **monorepo** structure. The frontend will be a responsive **Next.js** application styled with **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui**. Backend functionality, including the database, authentication, and storage, will be provided by **Supabase**. API logic will be handled via Next.js API routes, creating a tightly integrated and efficient development experience.

## Platform and Infrastructure Choice

- **Platform:** **Vercel** is the ideal hosting and deployment platform due to its seamless integration with Next.js, providing optimal performance, automatic scaling, and CI/CD.
- **Backend as a Service (BaaS):** **Supabase** will provide the PostgreSQL database, authentication, and object storage, abstracting away server management.

## Architectural Patterns

- **Serverless Architecture:** Leverages Vercel for hosting the Next.js app and API routes, and Supabase for the backend, eliminating the need to manage traditional servers.
- **Component-Based UI:** The frontend will be built using reusable React components, promoting maintainability and consistency.
- **Repository Pattern:** Data access will be abstracted into a dedicated layer to decouple business logic from Supabase-specific queries, making the code cleaner and easier to test.
