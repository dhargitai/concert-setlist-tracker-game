# 8. Next Steps

This completes the Product Requirements Document. The next step in our workflow is to engage our specialists to create the detailed design and architecture.

## UX Expert Prompt

- "Sally, please use this PRD to create a **UI/UX Specification**. Focus on the 'Duolingo-like' drag-and-drop interactions and the overall 'hippie aesthetic' defined in the UI Goals. Please also create a prompt for an AI UI generator like v0 to accelerate frontend development."

## Architect Prompt

- "Winston, please use this PRD and the confirmed technical assumptions (Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind, Monorepo, Serverless) to create a **Fullstack Architecture Document**. Define the Supabase database schema, the API endpoints, and the frontend project structure."
