# 3. User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The application should feel fun, professional, and highly intuitive. The primary goal is to create an engaging experience that encourages fans to participate and return for future shows. The interface will be clean, responsive, and easy to navigate, allowing a first-time user to understand and play a game within moments.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

The core interaction model for the games ("Setlist Bingo" and "Fill in the Setlist") will be a **Duolingo-style drag-and-drop system**. Users will be able to fluidly drag song titles from a list into designated slots on a bingo board or setlist template.

## Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the MVP will require the following conceptual screens:

- **Show Selection Screen:** A simple page to select the band and the specific show date.
- **Game Selection Screen:** A menu to choose which of the four game types to play for the selected show.
- **Game Interface Screen:** The main view where the user plays the selected game (e.g., the bingo board, the setlist template).
- **Post-Game Summary Screen:** A view to show the user their completed guesses after they submit. *(Note: This is an assumption based on a typical game flow).*

## Accessibility

- **Accessibility Level:** WCAG AA
- *(Note: To ensure a professional and inclusive product, I've made an assumption that we should aim for WCAG AA compliance. This means the app will be designed to be usable by people with a wide range of abilities.)*

## Branding

- The aesthetic will emulate the feel of `deadandcompany.com` without violating copyright. The design should incorporate a "hippie aesthetic" with pastels, cartoons, and rainbow motifs.

## Target Platforms

- **Platform:** Web Responsive
- The application will be a responsive website, optimized for a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop browsers.
