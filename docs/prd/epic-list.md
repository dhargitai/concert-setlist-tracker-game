# 5. Epic List

Here is the proposed high-level structure for building the application. I've broken the work into two distinct, sequential epics.

1. **Epic 1: Project Foundation & Core Navigation**
    - **Goal:** Establish the foundational project structure, set up the Next.js/Supabase/Tailwind stack, and implement the core user navigation, allowing a user to select a show and land on the game menu screen. This epic delivers a navigable shell of the application.
2. **Epic 2: Game Implementation & Gameplay Experience**
    - **Goal:** Implement all four of the core "Play for Fun" game modes (Bingo, Openers, Encore, Fill-in). This includes the main drag-and-drop interactions and the post-game summary screen. This epic delivers the core value and fun of the application.
